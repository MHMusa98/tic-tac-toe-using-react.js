# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in React

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using React. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid to try and win the game.

## Features

- **Player vs. Player**: Two players can play against each other on the same device.
- **Interactive Interface**: Click on the grid to mark X's and O's and see the game state update in real-time.
- **Win Detection**: The game detects and announces the winner when a player achieves three in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Getting Started

To run the Tic-Tac-Toe game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-react.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd tic-tac-toe-react

3. Install dependencies:
npm install

4. Start the development server:
npm start

5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to play the game.

## How to Play

1. Players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their symbol (X or O).
2. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

## Future Enhancements

- **Draw Detection**: Currently, the game does not detect draws when all cells are filled without a winner. This functionality will be added in a future update.
